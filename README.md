## before you start

install Docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop (it's
free!).

once Docker is installed:

1. run the Docker application.
2. in `Preferences > Advanced`, set Memory to the maximum possible value or at least 16GB, sometimes 32GB.
3. on Windows, you will need to select the drives that you will load samples
   from in `Settings > Shared Drives`. on Mac, you may need to do this in
   `Settings > Resources > File Sharing` if you are loading samples from
   outside your home directory.

## running

1. unzip spleeter.zip and add the `spleeter/` folder to your Places menu in Ableton
2. put `spleeter.amxd` onto any audio channel
3. select any audio clip in Ableton by clicking on it
4. press the start button in the spleeter device and wait. the first run may take a long time!

## troubleshooting

### spleeter seems to take forever to run

the first time spleeter runs, it needs to download a virtual machine. on slow
networks, this might take a long time. once this is done, subsequent runs
should be faster.

if it's still taking a long time, try splitting your input
audio into shorter pieces. on a reasonably fast computer, spleeter usually
takes about a minute to stem a 3-minute track.

### docker will not start on windows

make sure you have [virtualization
enabled](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003174386-How-can-I-enable-virtualization-VT-on-my-PC-) in your BIOS settings.

### spleeter can't run because files are missing

unlike most Max devices, spleeter.amxd depends on many files that need to be in
the same directory. if you move spleeter.amxd to a location, make sure to move all the contents of the spleeter folder to the new location.

### spleeter says 'Spleeter could not run.'

this is a generic error message and can happen for many reasons. here's a few
of the common ones:

#### spleeter is out of memory

see Step 2 of https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#before-you-start. if
you have already set the memory setting to the max, your audio might be too
long. try splitting your audio into 3-minute segments (split in Ableton
arrangement view, then right click and consolidate) and running it on
one segment at a time.

#### docker cannot access the drive on which your audio file is stored

see Step 3 of https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#before-you-start.
this often happens if you are loading files from a different hard drive or
audio files outside your home folder.

### spleeter says docker could not run

check that docker is running in your taskbar or task manager. if it's running,
then the issue might be that docker lacks network access. make sure your
firewall or proxy isn't [blocking
docker](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49387263/docker-error-response-from-daemon-get-https-registry-1-docker-io-v2-servic).

### help! it's still not working.

try opening up the max console in order to get more useful error messages.

### i know how to run terminal commands. any other debugging tips?

1. you can run the docker command manually in the terminal and see what
   happens:
   https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max/blob/241ccc291d915c0b82f601948f6989ccefaeffa9/spleeter.js#L64O
2. if you have a python environment set up, you could install the original
   spleeter library from https://pypi.org/project/spleeter/. there is no
   Ableton integration but that is something i have considered doing.
