# spleeter for max (native version)

ableton max device for separating a clip into stems (vocals, bass, drums,
other) **using an existing installation of spleeter**. if you aren't able to
install spleeter, check out
https://www.dropbox.com/s/cn90sqpx3cuzttb/spleeter.zip?dl=0 instead for the version that uses docker.

## before you start

note that all instructions were tested with Max 8.1 and may not work for earlier versions of Max.

### windows steps:

1. install ffmpeg following the instructions in https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-FFmpeg#installing-ffmpeg-in-windows
2. install python 3.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/ and disable the "path length variable limit" option when you get to the end of the install process
3. open windows environment variable editor and remove `.JS;` from PATHEXT (https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/114094235653-Setting-global-environment-variables-on-Windows)
4. open CMD.exe and type `pip install spleeter`

### macOS steps:

1. install homebrew: https://brew.sh/
2. open terminal and install python/ffmpeg/spleeter with the following commands:
```
brew install python
brew install ffmpeg
pip3 install spleeter
```
3. on some versions of MacOS, spleeter gets installed somewhere other than `/usr/local/bin/spleeter`. you can check this by typing `which spleeter` into the terminal. if this is the case, enter this into the terminal to fix the location:
```
ln -s $(which spleeter) /usr/local/bin/spleeter
```

note: spleeter currently requires python 3.7

## running

1. unzip spleeter-native.zip and add the `spleeter-native/` folder to your Places menu in Ableton
2. put `spleeter-native.amxd` onto any audio channel
3. select any audio clip in Ableton by clicking on it
4. press the start button in the spleeter device and wait.

## troubleshooting and FAQs

### spleeter seems to take forever to run

try splitting your input audio into shorter pieces.

### the start button disappears, then nothing happens

this may be because spleeter can't find what it's supposed to be splitting in the Ableton session. **you need to select an entire audio clip, not just highlight part of it.** to split an audio clip into a shorter segment, click on a point in the clip, press cmd or ctrl+e to split, then right-click and consolidate.


### 'pip(3) install spleeter' is failing

try `python -m pip install spleeter` or `python3 -m pip install spleeter` to see if that works for some reason.

open terminal/CMD.exe and type `pip --version` or `pip3 --version` to make sure you have the version with python 3.7. if not, you need to install python 3.7 with the instructions above.

you could also try https://pypi.org/help/#tls-deprecation to get some more useful error messages.

it's possible the issue is pip needs to be upgraded, which can be done using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49748063/pip-install-fails-for-every-package-could-not-find-a-version-that-satisfies.

## spleeter fails with command not found even though it works on command line

this might be because spleeter is not installed in a path that Max recognizes. on MacOS try entering this in terminal:

```
ln -s $(which spleeter) /usr/local/bin/spleeter
```

TODO: figure out what the equivalent is for windows

### it not working and i can't figure out why

try opening up the max console in order to get more useful error messages. instructions:

1. click on the rectangle icon in Spleeter to open max

3. click the button to run spleeter. you should see a bunch of console messages.

if this doesn't seem helpful, you could try this pre-release version which has better error messages: https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max/releases/tag/1.3.1-native

### can i run this in other DAWs?
